Motivation

Hi. My name is Jai-Gouk Kim, a newbie in merb community. I'm not a ruby guru. I started digging into merb recently and found out awesomeness of merb. I bought "Merb in Action" but there was no notice about further works and It's really hard to get informations about changes like between 1.0.7 and 1.0.7.1. Since I don't have experiences related with merb, I wanted explanations about them. Katz's blog posts are good but I need more than that. So I parsed rss feeds here.

Thanks to merb core team, rubypond, scrubber, jchris, monki, and FoobarWidget. Ruby community is cool! They really helped me to build this small app.
